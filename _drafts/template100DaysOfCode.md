### Day 1: May 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started building personal blog in Jekyll. Figured out Bootstrap 4 integration with https://experimentingwithcode.com/creating-a-jekyll-blog-with-bootstrap-4-and-sass-part-1/index.html

**Thoughts** Having fun learning Jekyll though it is taking a lot of research to learn how to do things. Glad I finally got started on this project instead of thinking about this project!
