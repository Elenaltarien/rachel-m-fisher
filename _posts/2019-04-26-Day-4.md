**Today's Progress**: Moved this site from GitHub pages to Netlify hosting. Moved kinda slow today due to migraine earlier.

**Thoughts**: I like Netlify. I'm going to move all of my sites there. If you have a github pages Jekyll blog that you'd like to move over to Netlify, it's easy to follow [their guide](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/05/11/migrating-your-jekyll-site-to-netlify/). Only thing of note is that their ruby version in the guide seems to be outdated. I had to use 2.6.2 for the build to work.
